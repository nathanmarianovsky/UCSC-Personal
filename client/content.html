			With some students and myself having an interest in learning about quantum computational theory I will be hosting a weekly seminar throughout the summer of 2020 in order to dwelve into the subject. As no prior knowledge outside of some linear algebra and basic ordinary differential equations is required, the plan is to start with the basics of quantum mechanics and build into understanding how quantum logic operates in comparison to classical logic. More specifically, it would be worthwhile to focus on topics such as RSA encryption, quantum search algorithms, quantum circuits, complexity classes of problems such as P and NP, etc...This seminar is not meant to be by any way a collection of serious lectures, but rather a sequence of presentations that invoke interesting questions for debate with hopefully people walking away having learned something. As it turns out there are a great many resources that can be used in order to help learn the material and use as a reference for a presentation. I have taken the liberty of listing some below.
			<br><br>
			In order to facilitate an open channel among all participants a discord chat has been set up whose link can be found above. Always feel free to mention anything of interest on the chat and if you have a desire to present on a topic let me know either through the chat or email so that a date and time can be decided.

    		<h4>Crash Course on Quantum Mechanics</h4>
    		<p>What is the physical motivation for a theory like quantum mechanics? Starting with this question we will explore the basics of understanding the structure of the theory in comparison to classical mechanics, specifically discussing what a wavefunction is and how the state of a particle evolves based on the behavior of the wavefunction. Once enough motivation is provided for the theory our goal will be to present the formalism of how a Hilbert space functions and what rules it imposes on the structure of a wavefunction. As an example we will explore the case of the infinite-square well and if time permits the quantum harmonic oscillator.</p>

    		<h4>Weirdness of Quantum Mechanics</h4>
    		<p>What makes the theory of quantum mechanics so weird for people to understand from an intuitive point of view? We will begin by dwelving into the workings of the Heisenberg uncertainy principle both in terms of what it implies physically and how it is mathematically formulated. Beyond the uncertainty principle there are also the results known as the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation, both of which have deep philosophical impacts on the interpretation of the physical world with the latter having been experimentally verified. All of these results will make it clear that a formulation of quantum logic will have to be intrinsically distinct from its classical counterpart, with the statement of the no-teleportation theorem making this evidently clear via an explanation that a quantum state cannot be reconstructed from a collection (even infintie) of classical bits.</p>
